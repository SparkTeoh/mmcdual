## The Fundraising Challenge [.text-h4]

You have a great business idea. You've built a solid product. You have customers and traction. But when you present your financial roadmap to investors, they're skeptical. The numbers don't tell a compelling story. The projections seem unrealistic. The opportunity isn't clear.

<Notice type="warning" title="The Financial Roadmap Problem">
  Most entrepreneurs create financial roadmaps that focus on numbers without telling a story. Investors don't just want to see projections—they want to understand the business model, growth strategy, and how you'll use their capital to create returns.
</Notice>

At MMC Financial Planning, we've helped dozens of Malaysian SMEs raise capital successfully. The difference between getting funded and getting rejected often comes down to the financial roadmap. Here's what investors really look for and how to deliver it.

## Why Financial Roadmaps Matter [.text-h4]

Your financial roadmap is more than just numbers—it's your business story told through financial projections.

<ListCheck>

- **Credibility**: Shows you understand your business financially
- **Vision**: Demonstrates where you're going and how you'll get there
- **Risk Assessment**: Helps investors evaluate risks and returns
- **Use of Funds**: Explains how you'll use their capital
- **Exit Strategy**: Shows path to returns for investors

## What Investors Really Look For [.text-h4]

### 1. A Compelling Growth Story [.text-h5]

Investors invest in growth, not just current performance. Your financial roadmap must tell a story of significant, achievable growth.

<Tabs>
  <Tab name="The Story Arc">
    **A Compelling Growth Story Includes:**

    - **Current State**: Where you are now (baseline)
    - **Growth Trajectory**: How you'll grow (the journey)
    - **Future State**: Where you'll be (the destination)
    - **Key Milestones**: Important checkpoints along the way
    - **Market Opportunity**: Why this growth is possible

    **Example Story:**
    - Today: RM2M revenue, 50 customers
    - Year 1: RM5M revenue, 150 customers (new market entry)
    - Year 3: RM15M revenue, 500 customers (market leadership)
    - Year 5: RM50M revenue, 2,000 customers (regional expansion)

  </Tab>

  <Tab name="Growth Drivers">
    **What Drives Growth:**

    - **Market Expansion**: New geographies, segments
    - **Product Development**: New offerings, features
    - **Sales & Marketing**: Customer acquisition strategies
    - **Partnerships**: Strategic alliances, channels
    - **Operational Efficiency**: Scaling without proportional costs

    **Show the "How":**
    Don't just project growth—explain how you'll achieve it:
    - "We'll enter 3 new cities with local partners"
    - "New product line will add RM5M in Year 2"
    - "Marketing investment will drive 2x customer acquisition"

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Realistic Yet Ambitious Projections [.text-h5]

<Notice type="info" title="The Balance">
  Investors want ambitious growth (they're looking for returns), but they also want realism (they've seen too many unrealistic projections). The best roadmaps balance both.
</Notice>

**What Makes Projections Credible:**

<Accordion label="Realistic Assumptions" group="projections" expanded="true">

**1. Market-Based Assumptions**

- Based on market research, not wishful thinking
- Benchmarked against similar companies
- Account for market size and growth rates
- Consider competitive dynamics

**Example:**
- Market size: RM500M, growing 15% annually
- Your target: 2% market share in Year 3
- Revenue: RM500M × 2% = RM10M (realistic)

**2. Historical Performance**

- If you have history, base projections on trends
- Show improvement over time
- Account for seasonality
- Consider one-time vs. recurring factors

**3. Unit Economics**

- Show revenue per customer
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
- Lifetime value (LTV)
- Payback period
- Unit economics should improve over time

</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Ambitious but Achievable" group="projections" expanded="false">

**Growth Targets:**

- **Year 1**: 50-100% growth (early stage, small base)
- **Year 2-3**: 30-50% growth (scaling phase)
- **Year 4-5**: 20-30% growth (mature growth)

**Red Flags:**
- 200%+ growth every year (unrealistic)
- No growth (not investable)
- Declining margins (unsustainable)
- No explanation of "how"

**Green Flags:**
- Consistent, improving growth
- Improving margins over time
- Clear path to profitability
- Specific growth drivers identified

</Accordion>

### 3. Clear Unit Economics [.text-h5]

Investors want to understand your business model at the unit level—how much does it cost to acquire a customer, and what are they worth?

<StatsWrapper>

  />
  <StatsItem
    icon="Target"
    title="3:1"
    description="Minimum LTV:CAC ratio"
  />

</StatsWrapper>

**Key Unit Economics Metrics:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab name="Customer Metrics">
    **Customer Economics:**

    - **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: Total cost to acquire one customer
    - **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**: Total revenue from one customer
    - **LTV:CAC Ratio**: Should be 3:1 or higher
    - **Payback Period**: How long to recover CAC (target: &lt;12 months)
    - **Gross Margin per Customer**: Profitability per customer

    **Example:**
    - CAC: RM500
    - LTV: RM2,000
    - LTV:CAC: 4:1 ✅
    - Payback: 6 months ✅
    - Gross Margin: 60% ✅

  </Tab>

  <Tab name="Product Metrics">
    **Product Economics:**

    - **Revenue per Unit**: Price × Volume
    - **Cost per Unit**: Direct costs
    - **Gross Margin**: Revenue - Cost
    - **Contribution Margin**: After variable costs
    - **Break-Even**: Units needed to cover fixed costs

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 4. Path to Profitability [.text-h5]

Investors want to see when and how you'll become profitable.

<Accordion label="Profitability Timeline" group="profitability" expanded="true">

**Typical Paths:**

**Fast Path (12-18 months):**
- Low capital requirements
- High margins
- Quick customer acquisition
- Efficient operations

**Medium Path (2-3 years):**
- Moderate capital needs
- Building market position
- Scaling operations
- Improving efficiency

- **Break-Even Point**: When revenue covers costs

</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Profitability Drivers" group="profitability" expanded="false">

1. **Scale**: Fixed costs spread over more revenue
2. **Efficiency**: Better processes, lower costs
3. **Pricing**: Ability to increase prices
4. **Mix**: Higher-margin products/services
5. **Technology**: Automation reducing costs

**Show the Math:**
- Current: RM2M revenue, -RM500K EBITDA (burning cash)
- Year 1: RM5M revenue, -RM200K EBITDA (reducing burn)
- Year 2: RM10M revenue, RM500K EBITDA (profitable)
- Year 3: RM15M revenue, RM2M EBITDA (13% margin)

</Accordion>

### 5. Clear Use of Funds [.text-h5]

Investors want to know exactly how you'll use their money and what returns it will generate.

<Notice type="warning" title="The Use of Funds Test">
  If you can't clearly explain how you'll use the capital and what returns it will generate, investors won't invest. Be specific and show ROI.
</Notice>

**Effective Use of Funds Breakdown:**

  <Tab name="Allocation">
    **Typical Allocation:**

    - **Sales & Marketing**: 30-40% (customer acquisition)
    - **Product Development**: 20-30% (product improvement)
    - **Operations**: 15-25% (scaling operations)
    - **Team**: 10-20% (hiring key people)
    - **Working Capital**: 10-15% (supporting growth)
    - **Reserves**: 5-10% (buffer for unexpected)

    **Example: RM2M Raise**

    - Operations: RM400K (20%)

    - RM200K team → Key hires → Faster execution

    - Valuation: RM10M → RM25M (2.5x)
    - Investor Return: 2.5x in 3 years

  We had a great product and customers, but our first fundraising attempts failed. Investors said our financial roadmap was "unrealistic" and "didn't tell a story." MMC Financial Planning helped us rebuild our financial roadmap with clear unit economics, a realistic path to profitability, and a compelling growth story. We raised RM5M in our next round—the investors said our financial roadmap was one of the best they'd seen. It wasn't just the numbers; it was how we told the story.

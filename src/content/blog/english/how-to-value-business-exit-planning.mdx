## The Valuation Challenge [.text-h4]

You've built a successful business. Now you're thinking about selling, but you have no idea what it's worth. Is it worth RM2 million? RM5 million? RM10 million? Without a proper valuation, you could leave millions on the table—or price yourself out of the market.

<Notice type="warning" title="The Valuation Gap">
  Most SME owners significantly overestimate or underestimate their business value. Without proper valuation methods, you risk selling too cheap or scaring away buyers with unrealistic prices.
</Notice>

At MMC Financial Planning, we've helped dozens of Malaysian SME owners value their businesses and prepare for successful exits. The key is understanding how buyers value businesses and preparing your company accordingly. Here's your comprehensive guide to business valuation and exit planning.

## Why Business Valuation Matters [.text-h4]

Understanding your business value is critical for several reasons:

<ListCheck>

- **Exit Planning**: Know what you're selling and when to sell
- **Negotiation**: Enter negotiations with realistic expectations
- **Preparation**: Identify value drivers and areas for improvement
- **Timing**: Know when the market conditions are right
- **Tax Planning**: Structure the sale for optimal tax outcomes
- **Succession**: Plan for family or management buyouts

## Understanding Business Valuation Methods [.text-h4]

There are three main approaches to valuing a business. Professional valuations typically use a combination of all three.

### Method 1: Income Approach (Most Common for SMEs) [.text-h5]

The income approach values a business based on its ability to generate future cash flows or profits.

<Tabs>
  <Tab name="EBITDA Multiple">
    **How It Works:**

    EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) is a measure of operating profitability.

    **Formula:**
    ```
    Business Value = EBITDA × Industry Multiple

    Example:
    EBITDA: RM1M
    Industry Multiple: 4x
    Business Value: RM4M
    ```

    **Why Buyers Use This:**
    - Shows true operating performance
    - Removes impact of financing and tax structure
    - Comparable across businesses
    - Industry-standard method

    **Common Multiples by Industry:**
    - Manufacturing: 3-6x EBITDA
    - Services: 2-5x EBITDA
    - Technology: 5-10x EBITDA
    - Retail: 2-4x EBITDA
    - Professional Services: 1-3x EBITDA

  </Tab>

  <Tab name="Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)">
    **How It Works:**

    Values business based on projected future cash flows, discounted to present value.

    **Formula:**
    ```
    Value = Sum of (Future Cash Flows / (1 + Discount Rate)^Year)

    Example (Simplified):
    Year 1 Cash Flow: RM500K
    Year 2 Cash Flow: RM600K
    Year 3 Cash Flow: RM700K
    Terminal Value: RM5M
    Discount Rate: 15%

    Value = Present value of all future cash flows
    ```

    **When to Use:**
    - Businesses with predictable cash flows
    - High-growth companies
    - When EBITDA doesn't reflect true value
    - Strategic buyers

  </Tab>

  <Tab name="Revenue Multiple">
    **How It Works:**

    Values business as a multiple of revenue (less common, but used for certain industries).

    **Formula:**
    ```
    Business Value = Annual Revenue × Revenue Multiple

    Example:
    Annual Revenue: RM5M
    Revenue Multiple: 1.5x
    Business Value: RM7.5M
    ```

    **When Used:**
    - Early-stage businesses (no profit yet)
    - SaaS or tech companies
    - High-growth, low-margin businesses
    - Market share-focused acquisitions

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Method 2: Market Approach [.text-h5]

The market approach values your business by comparing it to similar businesses that have been sold recently.

<Accordion label="Comparable Company Analysis" group="market-approach" expanded="true">

**How It Works:**

1. **Find Comparable Sales**: Identify similar businesses sold recently
2. **Analyze Multiples**: What multiples did they sell for?
3. **Adjust for Differences**: Account for size, growth, profitability
4. **Apply to Your Business**: Use adjusted multiples

**Example:**

Similar businesses sold for:
- Company A: 4.5x EBITDA
- Company B: 5.2x EBITDA
- Company C: 4.8x EBITDA
- Average: 4.8x EBITDA

Your business: RM1M EBITDA
Estimated Value: RM1M × 4.8 = RM4.8M

**Challenges:**
- Hard to find truly comparable sales
- Private company sales data is limited
- Need to adjust for differences
- Market conditions change

</Accordion>

### Method 3: Asset Approach [.text-h5]

The asset approach values a business based on the value of its assets minus liabilities.

<Notice type="info" title="When Asset Approach is Used">
  The asset approach is typically used for asset-heavy businesses (real estate, manufacturing) or businesses being liquidated. For most service-based SMEs, this method undervalues the business.
</Notice>

**Types of Asset Valuation:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab name="Book Value">
    **Accounting Value:**

    Assets - Liabilities = Net Book Value

    **Limitations:**
    - Doesn't reflect market value
    - Ignores intangible assets
    - Doesn't account for earning power
    - Usually undervalues business

  </Tab>

  <Tab name="Adjusted Book Value">
    **Market-Based Asset Value:**

    - Revalue assets to market value
    - Include intangible assets (brand, customer lists)
    - Account for liabilities
    - More accurate than book value

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Key Valuation Metrics Explained [.text-h4]

### EBITDA: The Foundation [.text-h5]

**EBITDA** is the most important metric for SME valuations. Understanding it is crucial.

<Accordion label="Calculating EBITDA" group="ebitda" expanded="true">

**Formula:**
```
EBITDA = Revenue - Operating Expenses (excluding interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization)

Or from Net Income:
EBITDA = Net Income + Interest + Taxes + Depreciation + Amortization
```

**Example:**
- Revenue: RM5M
- Operating Expenses: RM3.5M
- EBITDA: RM1.5M
- Interest: RM100K
- Taxes: RM200K
- Depreciation: RM150K
- Net Income: RM1.05M

**Why EBITDA Matters:**
- Shows operating profitability
- Removes impact of financing structure
- Comparable across businesses
- Industry standard for valuations

</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Normalizing EBITDA" group="ebitda" expanded="false">

**Adjustments Buyers Make:**

Buyers will "normalize" EBITDA by adjusting for:

1. **Owner Benefits**: Salary above market rate, personal expenses
2. **One-Time Expenses**: Non-recurring costs
3. **Non-Operating Income/Expenses**: Items not related to core business
4. **Market Rate Adjustments**: Rent, salaries, etc.

**Example:**

Reported EBITDA: RM1M
+ Owner salary above market: +RM200K
+ Personal expenses in business: +RM100K
- One-time legal fees: -RM50K
= Normalized EBITDA: RM1.25M

**Impact**: 25% higher valuation!

</Accordion>

</StatsWrapper>

- **Industry**: Some industries command higher multiples

  I thought my business was worth RM3M based on what I'd heard from other owners. MMC Financial Planning did a proper valuation and showed it was actually worth RM4.5M, but only if we made some improvements first. Over 18 months, they helped us normalize our EBITDA, reduce owner dependency, and build recurring revenue. When we sold, we got RM5.2M—73% more than my original estimate. The preparation made all the difference.

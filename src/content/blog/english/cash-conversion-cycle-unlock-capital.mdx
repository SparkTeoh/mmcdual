## The Hidden Capital Problem [.text-h4]

You're profitable on paper. Your P&L shows healthy margins. But your bank account is always tight. You're constantly juggling payments, waiting for customers to pay, and wondering where all the money went.

<Notice type="warning" title="The Working Capital Trap">
  Many profitable businesses struggle with cash flow because they have too much capital tied up in working capital—inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. This "hidden" capital could be funding growth instead.
</Notice>

The solution isn't always to borrow more money or raise capital. Often, the capital you need is already in your business—it's just locked up in your cash conversion cycle. At MMC Financial Planning, we've helped Malaysian SMEs unlock millions of ringgit in hidden capital by optimizing their cash conversion cycle.

## Understanding the Cash Conversion Cycle [.text-h4]

The **Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)** measures how long it takes for your business to convert investments in inventory and other resources into cash from sales.

### The Three Components [.text-h5]

<StatsWrapper>

  <StatsItem
    icon="Package"
    title="Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO)"
    description="How long inventory sits before sale"
  />
  <StatsItem
    icon="Clock"
    title="Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)"
    description="How long customers take to pay"
  />
  <StatsItem
    icon="Calendar"
    title="Days Payable Outstanding (DPO)"
    description="How long you take to pay suppliers"
  />

</StatsWrapper>

**The Formula:**

```
Cash Conversion Cycle = DIO + DSO - DPO

Where:
- DIO = Days Inventory Outstanding (lower is better)
- DSO = Days Sales Outstanding (lower is better)
- DPO = Days Payable Outstanding (higher is better)
```

### What the CCC Tells You [.text-h5]

<Tabs>
  <Tab name="Short Cycle (Good)">
    **CCC &lt; 30 Days**

    - Cash flows through your business quickly
    - Less capital tied up in working capital
    - More flexibility and liquidity
    - Better ability to fund growth internally

    **Example**: Retail business with fast inventory turnover and quick payments

  </Tab>

  <Tab name="Medium Cycle (Manageable)">
    **CCC 30-60 Days**

    - Moderate working capital requirements
    - Some capital tied up, but manageable
    - May need occasional short-term financing
    - Room for optimization

    **Example**: Service business with monthly billing cycles

  </Tab>

  <Tab name="Long Cycle (Problem)">
    **CCC > 60 Days**

    - Significant capital tied up
    - Cash flow pressure
    - Likely need external financing
    - High opportunity cost

    **Example**: Manufacturing with long production cycles and extended payment terms

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Notice type="info" title="The Impact">
  Reducing your CCC by just 10 days can unlock significant capital. For a business with RM5M in annual sales, a 10-day reduction frees up approximately RM137K in working capital.
</Notice>

## Component 1: Optimizing Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) [.text-h4]

**DIO** measures how long inventory sits in your warehouse before being sold.

### Calculating DIO [.text-h5]

```
DIO = (Average Inventory / Cost of Goods Sold) × 365

Example:
Average Inventory: RM500K
COGS: RM3M annually
DIO = (500,000 / 3,000,000) × 365 = 61 days
```

**What This Means**: Your inventory sits for 61 days before being sold. That's RM500K tied up for 2 months.

### Strategies to Reduce DIO [.text-h5]

<Accordion label="Inventory Management Best Practices" group="reduce-dio" expanded="true">

**1. Implement ABC Analysis**

Categorize inventory by value and turnover:
- **A-Items**: High value, high turnover (focus optimization here)
- **B-Items**: Medium value, medium turnover
- **C-Items**: Low value, low turnover (minimize or eliminate)

**2. Just-in-Time (JIT) Inventory**

- Order inventory only when needed
- Reduce safety stock levels
- Work with suppliers for faster delivery
- Use technology to track demand patterns

**3. Improve Forecasting**

- Use historical data and trends
- Account for seasonality
- Monitor market conditions
- Adjust orders based on actual sales

**4. Liquidate Slow-Moving Stock**

- Identify dead inventory (no sales in 90+ days)
- Discount or bundle to move it
- Donate for tax benefits
- Write off and free up space

</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Real-World Example" group="reduce-dio" expanded="false">

**Before Optimization:**
- Average Inventory: RM800K
- COGS: RM4M
- DIO: 73 days
- Capital Tied Up: RM800K

**After Optimization:**
- Average Inventory: RM500K (37% reduction)
- COGS: RM4M (same)
- DIO: 46 days (27 days improvement)
- Capital Freed: RM300K

**Impact**: RM300K freed up, plus reduced storage costs and obsolescence risk.

</Accordion>

## Component 2: Optimizing Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) [.text-h4]

**DSO** measures how long it takes customers to pay you after a sale.

### Calculating DSO [.text-h5]

```
DSO = (Accounts Receivable / Total Credit Sales) × 365

Example:
Accounts Receivable: RM400K
Annual Credit Sales: RM6M
DSO = (400,000 / 6,000,000) × 365 = 24 days
```

**What This Means**: On average, customers take 24 days to pay. That's RM400K tied up in receivables.

### Strategies to Reduce DSO [.text-h5]

<Tabs>
  <Tab name="Payment Terms">
    **Optimize Your Terms**

    - **Shorter Terms**: Net 15 instead of Net 30 (saves 15 days)
    - **Upfront Payments**: Require deposits or prepayment
    - **Progress Billing**: Bill as work progresses, not at completion
    - **Cash Discounts**: 2% discount for payment within 10 days

    **Example Impact:**
    - Current: Net 30, DSO = 35 days
    - Change to: Net 15, DSO = 20 days
    - Improvement: 15 days
    - Capital Freed: (15/365) × RM6M = RM247K

  </Tab>

  <Tab name="Collection Process">
    **Improve Collections**

    - **Invoice Immediately**: Send invoices the day you deliver
    - **Automated Reminders**: Systematize follow-up (7, 14, 21 days)
    - **Clear Payment Instructions**: Make it easy to pay
    - **Multiple Payment Methods**: Bank transfer, credit card, online
    - **Dedicated Collections**: Assign someone to follow up

    **Best Practice**: 
    - Day 0: Invoice sent
    - Day 7: Friendly reminder
    - Day 14: Second reminder with statement
    - Day 21: Phone call
    - Day 30+: Escalate or offer payment plan

  </Tab>

  <Tab name="Credit Management">
    **Reduce Risk and Delays**

    - **Credit Checks**: Verify customers before extending credit
    - **Credit Limits**: Set appropriate limits based on risk
    - **Payment History**: Monitor and adjust terms for slow payers
    - **Contracts**: Clear payment terms in writing
    - **Late Fees**: Enforce penalties for late payment

    **Red Flags to Watch:**
    - Customers consistently paying late
    - Requests for extended terms
    - Payment disputes or excuses
    - Changes in customer financial condition

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Notice type="info" title="Quick Win">
  Simply sending invoices immediately (instead of waiting a week) can reduce DSO by 5-7 days. For RM6M in annual sales, that's RM82K-115K in freed capital.
</Notice>

## Component 3: Optimizing Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) [.text-h4]

**DPO** measures how long you take to pay suppliers. Unlike DIO and DSO, you want DPO to be higher (within reason).

### Calculating DPO [.text-h5]

```
DPO = (Accounts Payable / Cost of Goods Sold) × 365

Example:
Accounts Payable: RM300K
COGS: RM4M annually
DPO = (300,000 / 4,000,000) × 365 = 27 days
```

**What This Means**: You're paying suppliers, on average, 27 days after receiving goods/services. This is essentially an interest-free loan from suppliers.

### Strategies to Increase DPO (Safely) [.text-h5]

<Accordion label="Negotiate Better Terms" group="increase-dpo" expanded="true">

**1. Extend Payment Terms**

- **Current**: Net 30
- **Target**: Net 45 or Net 60
- **Approach**: Frame as partnership, show growth plans, offer volume commitments

**2. Take Early Payment Discounts Strategically**

- **2/10 Net 30**: 2% discount for payment in 10 days
- **Calculate**: Is 2% worth paying 20 days early?
- **Rule**: Only take discount if cost of capital > discount rate

**Example:**
- Discount: 2% for paying 20 days early
- Annualized: (2% / 20) × 365 = 36.5% annual rate
- If your cost of capital &lt; 36.5%, take the discount
- If your cost of capital > 36.5%, don't take the discount

**3. Use Supplier Credit Cards**

- Extend payment by 30-45 days
- Earn rewards points
- Build credit history
- Maintain supplier relationships

</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Balance DPO with Relationships" group="increase-dpo" expanded="false">

**Important Considerations:**

- **Don't Overextend**: Paying too late damages supplier relationships
- **Communicate**: If you need extended terms, discuss it upfront
- **Be Reliable**: Once you agree to terms, stick to them
- **Volume Leverage**: Larger orders = better payment terms
- **Strategic Partnerships**: Key suppliers deserve better terms

**Best Practice**: 
- Pay on time (or slightly early) to key suppliers
- Negotiate extended terms for non-critical suppliers
- Use payment timing as a strategic tool, not a cash flow crutch

</Accordion>

## The Complete Optimization Strategy [.text-h4]

Optimizing your cash conversion cycle requires a holistic approach across all three components.

### Step 1: Calculate Your Current CCC [.text-h5]

<Accordion label="Gathering the Data" group="optimization-strategy" expanded="true">

**You Need:**

1. **Average Inventory**: (Beginning + Ending) / 2
2. **Cost of Goods Sold**: Annual COGS
3. **Accounts Receivable**: Average AR balance
4. **Total Credit Sales**: Annual credit sales
5. **Accounts Payable**: Average AP balance

**Calculate:**
- DIO = (Average Inventory / COGS) × 365
- DSO = (AR / Credit Sales) × 365
- DPO = (AP / COGS) × 365
- CCC = DIO + DSO - DPO

</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Benchmarking" group="optimization-strategy" expanded="false">

**Compare to Industry Standards:**

- **Retail**: CCC typically 20-40 days
- **Manufacturing**: CCC typically 40-80 days
- **Services**: CCC typically 10-30 days
- **Wholesale**: CCC typically 30-60 days

**Your Goal**: Be in the top quartile of your industry, or better yet, beat industry average by 20-30%.

</Accordion>

### Step 2: Identify Optimization Opportunities [.text-h5]

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 3: Calculate Capital Impact [.text-h5]

<StatsWrapper>

  <StatsItem
    icon="DollarSign"
    title="10 Days"
    description="CCC reduction target"
  />
  <StatsItem
    icon="TrendingUp"
    title="RM137K"
    description="Capital freed per RM5M sales (10-day reduction)"
  />
  <StatsItem
    icon="Target"
    title="20-30 Days"
    description="Realistic optimization target"
  />

</StatsWrapper>

**The Math:**

```
Capital Freed = (CCC Reduction in Days / 365) × Annual Sales

Example:
Annual Sales: RM5M
CCC Reduction: 20 days
Capital Freed = (20 / 365) × 5,000,000 = RM274K
```

**This is capital you can use for:**
- Growth investments
- Debt reduction
- Cash reserves
- Strategic initiatives
- **Without taking on new debt!**

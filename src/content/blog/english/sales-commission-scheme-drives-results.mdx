## The Commission Problem [.text-h4]

Your sales team is making good money. They're hitting their targets. But when you look closer, you realize you're paying them for being present, not for performance. The top performers get the same commission rate as average performers. The team is comfortable, but you're not getting the growth you need.

<Notice type="warning" title="The Attendance Trap">
  Many sales commission schemes reward activity instead of results. This creates a culture of busyness rather than performance, and you end up paying for attendance instead of achievement.
</Notice>

At MMC Financial Planning, we've helped dozens of Malaysian SMEs redesign their sales commission structures. The difference between a good commission scheme and a great one is the difference between a comfortable sales team and a high-performing one. Here's how to design a commission structure that actually drives results.

## Why Most Commission Schemes Fail [.text-h4]

Traditional commission structures often fail because they:

<ListCheck>

- **Reward Activity, Not Results**: Paying for calls made instead of deals closed
- **Lack Differentiation**: Same rate for all, regardless of performance
- **Create Comfort Zones**: Easy targets that don't push performance
- **Ignore Team Goals**: Individual focus without company alignment
- **Are Too Complex**: Confusing structures that demotivate
- **Don't Adapt**: Static schemes that don't evolve with business needs

## The Principles of Effective Commission Design [.text-h4]

### Principle 1: Align Incentives with Business Goals [.text-h5]

Your commission scheme should drive behaviors that support your business objectives.

<Tabs>
  <Tab name="Revenue Growth">
    **If Your Goal is Revenue Growth:**

    - Commission on revenue, not just deals closed
    - Higher rates for new customers vs. renewals
    - Accelerators for exceeding targets
    - Team bonuses for company-wide goals

    **Example Structure:**
    - Base: 5% on all sales
    - Accelerator: 7% on sales above quota
    - New Customer Bonus: +2% for first-time buyers

  </Tab>

  <Tab name="Profitability">
    **If Your Goal is Profitability:**

    - Commission on gross margin, not revenue
    - Higher rates for high-margin products
    - Penalties for discounting too much
    - Rewards for upselling profitable add-ons

    **Example Structure:**
    - Base: 3% on revenue
    - Margin Bonus: +1% for sales above 40% margin
    - Discount Penalty: -0.5% for discounts >10%

  </Tab>

  <Tab name="Customer Retention">
    **If Your Goal is Retention:**

    - Commission on customer lifetime value
    - Higher rates for multi-year contracts
    - Renewal bonuses
    - Penalties for churn

    **Example Structure:**
    - Base: 4% on initial sale
    - Renewal Bonus: 2% on year 2, 3% on year 3+
    - Churn Penalty: -1% commission if customer leaves within 12 months

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Principle 2: Create Clear Performance Tiers [.text-h5]

Different performance levels should earn different commission rates. This motivates improvement and rewards excellence.

<Accordion label="Tiered Commission Structure" group="tiers" expanded="true">

**Example: Three-Tier System**

**Tier 1: Below Target (0-80% of quota)**
- Commission Rate: 3%
- Message: "You need to improve to earn more"

**Tier 2: At Target (80-100% of quota)**
- Commission Rate: 5%
- Message: "You're meeting expectations"

**Tier 3: Above Target (100%+ of quota)**
- Commission Rate: 7% (with accelerators)
- Message: "Excellence is rewarded"

**Benefits:**
- Clear path to higher earnings
- Motivates improvement
- Rewards top performers appropriately
- Creates healthy competition

</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Accelerator Structure" group="tiers" expanded="false">

**Progressive Accelerators:**

- **100-110% of quota**: 7% commission
- **110-125% of quota**: 9% commission
- **125-150% of quota**: 11% commission
- **150%+ of quota**: 13% commission + bonus

**Why This Works:**
- Rewards incremental improvement
- Creates stretch goals
- Top performers earn significantly more
- Motivates continued performance

</Accordion>

### Principle 3: Balance Individual and Team Incentives [.text-h5]

Individual performance drives results, but team alignment drives company success.

<Notice type="info" title="The Balance">
  Too much individual focus creates internal competition and silos. Too much team focus reduces individual accountability. The best schemes balance both.
</Notice>

**Hybrid Approach:**

    title="70-80%"
    description="Individual commission component"
  />
  <StatsItem
    icon="Users"
    title="20-30%"
    description="Team/company bonus component"
  />

</StatsWrapper>

**Example Structure:**

```
Individual Commission: 6% of personal sales
Team Bonus: 2% of personal sales if team hits target
Company Bonus: 1% of personal sales if company hits target

Total Potential: 9% (if all targets met)
```

**Benefits:**
- Individual accountability maintained
- Team collaboration encouraged
- Company alignment created
- Balanced motivation

## Common Commission Structures and When to Use Them [.text-h4]

### Structure 1: Straight Commission [.text-h5]

**How It Works:**
- Fixed percentage of all sales
- No base salary (or very low base)
- All compensation is variable

**Example:**
- 8% commission on all sales
- No base salary
- Salesperson earns: Sales × 8%

**Best For:**
- High-volume, transactional sales
- Experienced sales teams
- Businesses with variable demand
- Low-cost products/services

**Pros:**
- Low fixed costs
- High motivation (eat what you kill)
- Easy to understand
- Scales with revenue

**Cons:**
- High risk for salespeople
- Difficult to attract talent
- Can encourage short-term thinking
- No security for sales team

### Structure 2: Base Salary + Commission [.text-h5]

**How It Works:**
- Fixed base salary
- Commission on top of base
- Lower commission rate than straight commission

**Example:**
- Base Salary: RM5,000/month
- Commission: 3% on all sales
- Salesperson earns: RM5,000 + (Sales × 3%)

**Best For:**
- Most B2B sales environments
- Complex, consultative sales
- Businesses needing stability
- Building long-term relationships

**Pros:**
- Attracts better talent
- Provides security
- Supports relationship building
- Reduces turnover

**Cons:**
- Higher fixed costs
- Can create complacency
- Need to manage underperformers
- More complex to administer

### Structure 3: Tiered Commission with Accelerators [.text-h5]

**How It Works:**
- Base commission rate
- Higher rates for exceeding targets
- Progressive accelerators for top performance

**Example:**
- 0-80% quota: 3% commission
- 80-100% quota: 5% commission
- 100-125% quota: 7% commission
- 125%+ quota: 10% commission + bonus

**Best For:**
- Performance-driven cultures
- Businesses with clear targets
- Motivating top performers
- Scaling sales teams

**Pros:**
- Rewards excellence
- Motivates improvement
- Clear performance expectations
- Differentiates top performers

**Cons:**
- Can demotivate low performers

- More complex calculations
- Need to manage expectations

### Structure 4: Profit-Based Commission [.text-h5]

**How It Works:**
- Commission based on gross margin or profit
- Rewards selling high-margin products
- Penalizes excessive discounting

**Example:**
- Base: 2% of revenue
- Margin Bonus: +1% for sales above 40% margin
- Discount Penalty: -0.5% for discounts >15%

**Best For:**
- Profit-focused businesses
- Product portfolios with varying margins
- Businesses struggling with discounting
- Long-term profitability goals

**Pros:**
- Aligns with profitability
- Rewards profitable behavior
- Reduces discounting
- Better margin management

**Cons:**
- More complex to calculate
- Requires margin visibility
- Can reduce sales volume
- Harder for sales team to understand

  Our old commission structure was paying everyone the same rate regardless of performance. Top performers were leaving, and average performers were comfortable. MMC Financial Planning helped us redesign a tiered structure with accelerators. Within 6 months, our top performers were earning 40% more, our average performers improved by 25%, and we saw a 35% increase in overall sales. The structure now rewards performance, not just presence.

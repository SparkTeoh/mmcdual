    title: "Is Your Budget a \"Dead Document\"?"
    description: |
      Most companies treat budgeting as a once-a-year administrative chore. They use "hard-coded" numbers based on gut feelings, resulting in static spreadsheets that break the moment market conditions change.

      **The Consequence:**
      * You can't simulate "What-If" scenarios.
      * You can't prove your valuation to banks or investors.
      * You are driving your business looking in the rear-view mirror.

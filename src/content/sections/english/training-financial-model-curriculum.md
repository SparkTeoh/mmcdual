        title: "Module 1: Strategic Target Setting"
        content: |
          **The Concept:**
          
          Stop guessing your next year's revenue. We teach you the "3-Goal Framework" to set precise targets for Revenue, Cost, and Cash Flow.
          
          **The Model:**
          
          You will build a **Revenue Driver Model**. Instead of just inputting "10% growth," you will model the specific drivers—Market Size (TAM), Customer Volume, and Pricing Strategy—to create a defensible top-line forecast that investors can trust.

        title: "Module 2: Cost Structure & Breakeven Analysis"
        content: |
          **The Concept:**
          
          Not all costs are created equal. We guide you to separate Variable Costs (COGS) from Fixed Costs (Opex) to understand your true operating leverage.
          
          **The Model:**
          
          You will construct a dynamic **Breakeven Point (BEP) Calculator**. This tool allows you to instantly visualize your "Safety Zone" and calculate exactly how many units you need to sell to cover your overheads and hit your target profit.

        title: "Module 3: Profit Optimization (Gross Margin)"
        content: |
          **The Concept:**
          
          Revenue is vanity; Profit is sanity. We dive deep into Gross Profit Margin (GPM) analysis to identify which products or services are bleeding money and which are your true cash cows.
          
          **The Model:**
          
          You will learn **Sensitivity Analysis** in Excel. Build "Toggle Switches" to simulate scenarios: *What happens to Net Profit if we raise prices by 5% but volume drops by 10%?* The model gives you the answer before you take the risk.

        title: "Module 4: Cash Flow & Working Capital"
        content: |
          **The Concept:**
          
          Profit does not equal Cash. Many profitable companies die because they run out of money. We teach you to manage the gap between "earning" and "collecting."
          
          **The Model:**
          
          You will build a **Rolling Cash Flow Forecast** linked to your Balance Sheet. We model the Cash Conversion Cycle—optimizing Accounts Receivable (AR), Inventory, and Accounts Payable (AP)—to unlock trapped cash and ensure long-term solvency.

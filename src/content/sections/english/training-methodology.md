title: "The \"Profit-First\" Mindset Shift"
subtitle: "Our Methodology"
description: |
  At MMC, we believe that financial literacy is not just for the Finance Department. It is the universal language of business success.<br><br>

  Our training methodology is built on a simple premise: **Empowerment through Understanding**.<br><br>

  When a Sales Director understands how payment terms affect cash flow, they stop offering bad credit terms. When an Operations Manager understands how efficiency impacts Gross Margin, they start reducing waste.<br><br>

  We don't just lecture; we install a "Profit OS" into your team's DNA. We replace "Silo Thinking" with "Systems Thinking," ensuring that every employee—from junior execs to the C-Suite—understands exactly how their role contributes to the company's profit and valuation.

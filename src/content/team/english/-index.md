  description: |-
    MMC Financial Planning was established in 1997 and officially licensed by the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) in 2008. For over two decades, under the pioneering leadership of founders PC Lim and Phillip Tay, we have remained steadfast in our commitment to corporate financial planning, becoming the silent engine behind the growth of hundreds of enterprises.<br><br>
    Today, this rich legacy of insight and experience has been entrusted to a new generation of leadership. We have not only inherited the battle-tested philosophy of "Strategic Budgeting" but have also evolved it to meet the dynamic demands of the modern business era.<br><br>
    We believe that true management consulting isn't about abstract theory—it's about practical wisdom forged in the fires of real business challenges. This wisdom is our greatest asset in helping your company transition from "accidental success" to "inevitable growth."

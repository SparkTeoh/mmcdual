## Ending the Internal "Price War": How Correcting Transfer Pricing & Incentives Unlocked Hidden Profits in Both Factory and Retail

### Client Profile [.text-h4]

**Industry**: Integrated Food Manufacturing (Central Kitchen) & Retail Chain
**Structure**: Centralized production facility supplying multiple self-owned outlets.

**Key Struggles**: Artificial profitability in manufacturing, margin erosion in retail, toxic "blame culture," and low workforce productivity due to overtime dependency.

## The Challenge: A House Divided [.text-h3]

Before MMC’s intervention, the company was profitable on paper, but the owner felt trapped in a constant mediation battle between his two business units. The organization was paralyzed by three systemic issues:

<ListCheck>

- **Distorted Transfer Pricing & The "Scapegoat" Effect**: The Central Kitchen (Factory) was charging Retail outlets inflated prices to cover its own operational inefficiencies. This created "fake" factory profits while retail outlets seemingly bled, using high supply costs as an excuse for poor performance.

- **The "Milk the Clock" Culture**: The compensation structure inadvertently punished efficiency. Employees relied heavily on Overtime (OT) pay, creating a perverse incentive to work slowly during regular hours to trigger OT rates, resulting in sluggish production and soaring labor costs.

- **Management Blind Spots**: The owner couldn't see the true unit economics. Financial data was clouded by internal transfer pricing, making it impossible to identify which products or outlets were actually bleeding cash.

## The Solution: The MMC Profit Budgeting System [.text-h3]

<Notice type="info" title="MMC Profit Budgeting System">

We implemented the MMC Profit Budgeting System to dismantle internal silos and align the entire organization around true value creation.

</Notice>

<Accordion label="Phase 1: Market-Based Benchmarking (The Truth Serum)" group="solution-phases" expanded="true">

We stopped the Factory from dictating prices. We implemented a **Market-Based Transfer Pricing** policy:

*   The Factory must supply goods to Retail at rates comparable to external third-party suppliers.
*   **Impact**: This stripped away the Factory's safety net. If they couldn't produce at market rates, it exposed their inefficiency (wastage, workflow, procurement), forcing them to fix the root cause rather than passing the cost downstream.

</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Phase 2: Accountability & KPI Restructuring" group="solution-phases" expanded="false">

With pricing fixed, the excuses evaporated. We assigned clear, non-negotiable metrics:

*   **For Retail**: Store Managers could no longer blame "cost of goods." They were now held accountable for **Net Profit** and **Sales Mix**. They had to actively push high-margin SKUs and manage in-store wastage to hit their targets.
*   **For Factory**: The Production Lead was KPI'd on **Yield Rate** and **Cost Per Unit**. Efficiency became their only path to hitting targets.

</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Phase 3: The 'Gain-Sharing' Incentive Switch" group="solution-phases" expanded="false">

We radically overhauled the compensation model to break the OT addiction:

*   **Defined Standard Output**: We calculated exactly how much output a motivated team should produce in standard hours.
*   **Profit Sharing**: We told the staff: "If you finish the work in standard hours, the money we save on OT doesn't just go to the company—a significant portion goes back to you as a performance bonus."
*   **Result**: The mindset shifted from "Time Spent" to "Work Done."

</Accordion>

## The Results: From Conflict to Synchronization [.text-h3]

Within one quarter of implementation, the dynamic of the company shifted from internal conflict to synchronized execution:

<ListCheck>

- **Operational Truth**: The Factory identified and fixed three major wastage points that were previously hidden by high transfer prices. Production costs dropped by **18%**.

- **Retail Revival**: Store Managers, no longer able to blame the factory, shifted focus to upselling high-margin add-ons, boosting Store Net Profit margins by **8%**.

- **Labor Efficiency**: Overtime costs plummeted, yet average employee take-home pay increased due to the new performance bonuses. The company achieved higher output with fewer total man-hours.

- **Unified Culture**: The "us vs. them" mentality vanished. Both sides realized they were fighting for the same pool of profit.

## Voice of the Customer [.text-h3]

<Testimonial
  customerName="Managing Director"
  customerRole="Owner"
  customerCompanyName="Food Manufacturing Group"
>

For years, my Retail team blamed the Factory for being expensive, and the Factory blamed Retail for not selling enough. I was stuck in the middle. MMC came in and clarified the numbers. By fixing the transfer price and the incentives, the arguments stopped. Now, the Factory focuses on efficiency, Retail focuses on sales strategy, and I finally have peace of mind.

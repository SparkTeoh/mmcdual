## Case Study: FMCG Manufacturing & Wholesale - Millions in Revenue, Pennies in Profit

### Client Profile [.text-h4]

Company S is a long-established snack manufacturer specializing in seeds, nuts, and traditional confectionery. While they dominate their regional market with strong brand recognition and generate multi-million Ringgit revenues, they were suffering from the classic FMCG trap: "Volume Vanity" — running a factory at full capacity while their bank account remained stagnant.

## The Challenge: Profit Paralysis [.text-h3]

Despite their scale, their Net Profit Margin was hovering dangerously close to 1%. The business was operating on "gut-feel" margins and faced critical pain points:

<ListCheck>

- **The "Black Box" of Costing**: The business failed to accurately account for production shrinkage (weight loss), packaging overheads, and logistics. Pricing was based on incomplete data, effectively subsidizing customers with every sale.
- **Distributor Dependency (The 6% Bleed)**: 40% of sales were controlled by a single agent who took a flat 6% commission. Company S had no direct access to end retailers and was held hostage by this single channel.
- **Organizational Stagnation**: The team consisted of "Order Takers," not "Sales Hunters." Without performance-based incentives, there was no motivation to expand the market, leaving the founder to micromanage everything.

## The Solution: Financial Clarity & Channel Reclamation [.text-h3]

<Notice type="info" title="Three-Phased Transformation Strategy">

MMC Financial Planning intervened with a strategy focused on Financial Clarity, Channel Reclamation, and Incentive Alignment.

</Notice>

<Accordion label="Phase 1: Strategic Cost Engineering" group="solution-phases" expanded="true">

**Wastage & Yield Analysis**: We moved beyond basic accounting to uncover the true cost of goods sold (COGS). We recalculated unit economics for every SKU, factoring in raw material shrinkage and hidden logistics costs.

**Profitability Matrix**: We identified "Cash Cows" versus "Loss Leaders." This allowed the company to phase out low-margin OEM work and refocus production capacity on their high-margin proprietary brand.

</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Phase 2: Channel Strategy Pivot" group="solution-phases" expanded="false">

**Direct-to-Market Transition**: To stop the 6% margin bleed and bypass the middleman, we helped the founder build an internal sales capability to service wholesalers and retailers directly.

**Tiered Pricing Strategy**: We introduced volume-based pricing tiers for wholesalers, redirecting the margin previously lost to the agent back into the company’s net profit and the internal sales team's pockets.

</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Phase 3: The Incentive Framework" group="solution-phases" expanded="false">

**Commission Restructuring**: We transformed the culture from "Fixed Salary" to "Pay-for-Performance." We designed a commission scheme that rewards new account acquisition and high-margin product sales.

**Operational KPIs**: For production and admin teams, we introduced efficiency-based bonuses to align their daily tasks with the company's financial health.

</Accordion>

## The Impact: From Production-Focused to Profit-Focused [.text-h3]

<ListCheck>

- **Margin Recovery**: By optimizing pricing and cutting out the middleman, the company is projected to improve Gross Profit Margins by **5-8%**.
- **Market Control**: They have begun building their own proprietary customer database, reducing risk and ending their reliance on a single distributor.
- **Operational Freedom**: With clear roles and incentives in place, the founder has stepped back from daily firefighting to focus on strategic expansion.
- **Culture Shift**: The sales team transformed into "hungry hunters" driven by the new incentive structure.

## Client Voice [.text-h3]

<Testimonial
  customerName="Founder"
  customerRole="Owner"
  customerCompanyName="Company S"
>

For years, I thought the problem was that we weren't selling enough. MMC showed me that we were selling too much of the wrong things to the wrong people. They didn't just give me a report; they helped me rebuild my cost structure and gave me the confidence to take back control of my sales channels. For the first time in years, I can see exactly where my profit is coming from.

</Testimonial>

<Notice type="info" title="Consultant's Note">

**Spark Liang**: "In the FMCG sector, volume often masks inefficiency. Many business owners are afraid to touch their pricing or sales channels for fear of losing revenue. Company S proved that revenue is vanity, but profit is sanity. By having the courage to confront their true costs and restructure their channel strategy, they didn't just save money—they fundamentally increased the value of their business."
